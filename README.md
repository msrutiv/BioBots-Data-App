# BioBots-Data-App

Hello! Here is my attempt at a web application to analyze BioBots print data.

The app was made using Bootstrap, Express, and Firebase.

Using the app you can: <br>
1) Upload data to the database from JSON files <br>
2) Search for a specific data point (called an entry, with numbers between 0 and 9999) <br>
3) Search for all data that matches a certain query (which is curently only Wellplate Type but this feature can easily be extended for other queries) <br>
4) View a short data analysis summary for search results <br>

The Firebase database can be accessed at https://biobots-data-app.firebaseio.com/

To run the app: <br>
1) Download all the files <br>
2) Type 'npm start' from the directory they've been dowloaded to <br>
3) Go to localhost:3000 on you favorite browser <br>

Voila!
